## Introduction

This tutorial will take you through the process of mapping a QTL and searching 
for candidate genes for DNA damage from benzene exposure. The adverse health 
effects of benzene, including leukemia and aplastic anemia, were first studied 
in occupational settings in which workers were exposed to high benzene 
concentrations. Environmental sources of benzene exposure typically come from 
the petrochemical industry, however, a personâ€™s total exposure can be increased 
from cigarettes, consumer products, gas stations, and gasoline powered engines 
or tools stored at home. 

Exposure thresholds for toxicants are often determined using animal models that
have limited genetic diversity, including standard inbred and outbred rats and 
mice. These animal models fail to capture the influence of genetic diversity on 
toxicity response, an important component of human responses to chemicals such 
as benzene. The Diversity Outbred (DO) mice reflect a level of genetic diversity
similar to that of humans.

The data comes from a toxicology study in which Diversity Outbred (DO) mice were
exposed to benzene via inhalation for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks
[(French, J. E., et al. (2015) <i>Environ Health Perspect</i> 123(3): 237-245)](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408202/).
The study was conducted in two equally sized cohort of 300 male mice each, for a
total of 600 mice. They were then sacrificed and reticulocytes (red blood cell 
precursors) were isolated from bone marrow. The number of micro-nucleated 
reticulocytes, a measure of DNA damage, was then measured in each mouse. The 
goal is to map gene(s) that influence the level of DNA damage in the bone 
marrow.

## DO Reference Data

As you work with DO data, you may need different reference files. These are
complied on a JAX website at: 
<https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/genetic-diversity-initiative/tools-data/diversity-outbred-reference-data>.
There are links to the markers and founder genotypes as well as the standard
colors that we use for the eight founder strains.

## Open the qtl_mapping Project.

If you have not opened the qtl_mapping project, do this now so that your
script and console will run in the correct directory. 

1. From the File menu, select "Open Project...".
1. Navigate to the project that you created in your Desktop/qtl_mapping folder
and open it.

This should reset your RStudio window and close any files.

## Create a New Markdown File

Create a new R Markdown file and save it in the "Desktop/scripts" folder as
"do_qtl_mapping.Rmd".

## Load Libraries

The primary library that we will use is [qtl2](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl2).
You should have `qtl2` installed from the Setup that you performed before the
workshop.

```{r warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggbeeswarm))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(qtl2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(qtl2convert))
```

## Load and Explore the Data

The data for this tutorial has been saved as an R binary file that contains 
several data objects.  Load it in now by running the following command in your 
new script.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

The code below is needed to load in the data objects to build the lesson on
Github. The `*.Rdata` file is over 200 Mb and Github has a file size limit of
100 Mb. The students should **NOT** run the next block.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r include=FALSE}
# We have to build the probs object for the Workbench site. The students can
# load it in directly.
probs_files = dir('./data', pattern = '^probs_chr', full.names = TRUE)
chr_names   = gsub('^probs_chr|\\.rds$', '', basename(probs_files))
probs_files = probs_files[order(as.numeric(chr_names))]
chr_names   = chr_names[order(as.numeric(chr_names))]

probs = lapply(probs_files, readRDS)
names(probs) = chr_names
attr(probs, 'is_x_chr')    = setNames(c(rep(FALSE, 19), TRUE), chr_names)
attr(probs, 'crosstype')   = 'do'
attr(probs, 'alleles')     = LETTERS[1:8]
attr(probs,' alleleprobs') = TRUE
attr(probs, 'class')       = c('calc_genoprob', 'list')

pheno = read.csv('./data/pheno.csv')
rownames(pheno) = pheno$X
pheno = pheno[,-1]

```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

This is the only block that the students need to run.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r eval=FALSE}
load("./data/qtl2_demo_grcm39.Rdata")
```

We loaded in four data objects from the *.Rdata file. Look at the Environment 
tab to see what was loaded. You should see an object called `pheno` which 
contains the phenotypes. There are two objects called `gmap` and `pmap`, which 
contain the marker positions in genetic and physical coordinates. Finally, there
is an object called `probs` which contains the founder allele probabilities for 
each mouse at each marker.

### Phenotypes

`pheno` is a data frame containing the phenotype data. Click on the blue circle
to the left of `pheno` in the Environment pane to view its contents.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

The sample IDs **must** be in the rownames of `pheno` for qtl2 to work. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

`pheno` contains the sample ID, the study cohort, the concentration of 
benzene and several blood cell measurements. Note that the sample IDs are also 
stored in the rownames of `pheno`. 


In order to save time for this tutorial, we will only
map with `r sum(pheno$conc == 100)` samples from the 100 ppm dosing group.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: How many mice are there in the phenotype data?

Look in the Environment tab or use the Console to figure out how many mice
there are in the phenotype data.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 
 
You can look at the number of observations in the Environment tab or you can
get the number of rows in `pheno` in the Console.
 
```{r}
nrow(pheno)
```

There are 598 mice in the phenotype data.

:::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 2: How many mice are there from each sex?

Use an R command to determine how many mice there are from each sex.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 
 
You can look at the number of observations in the Environment tab or you can
get the number of rows in `pheno` in the Console.
 
```{r}
count(pheno, sex)
```


All of the mice are male.

:::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 3: How is the "prop.bm.mn.ret" phenotype distributed?

Make histogram of the "prop.bm.mn.ret" column and assess whether it is normally
distributed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 
 
You can look at the number of observations in the Environment tab or you can
get the number of rows in `pheno` in the Console.
 
```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pheno, mapping = aes(prop.bm.mn.ret)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Bone Marrow MN-RETs") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

The bone marrow MN-RET values do not look normally distributed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 4: How is the log("prop.bm.mn.ret") phenotype distributed?

Take the log of the "prop.bm.mn.ret" column and make a histogram.Assess whether 
it is normally distributed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 
 
You can look at the number of observations in the Environment tab or you can
get the number of rows in `pheno` in the Console.
 
```{r warning=FALSE}
pheno |>
  mutate(log_mnret = log(prop.bm.mn.ret)) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(log_mnret)) +
    geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of log(Bone Marrow MN-RETs)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

The log of the bone marrow MN-RET values look more normally distributed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's add a column containing the log-transformed phenotype to our `pheno`
object.

```{r}
pheno <- pheno |>
           mutate(log_mnret = log(prop.bm.mn.ret))
```



Some researchers are concerned about the reproducibility of DO studies. The 
argument is that each DO mouse is unique and therefore can never be reproduced. 
But this misses the point of using the DO. While mice are the sampling unit, in 
QTL mapping we are sampling the founder alleles at each locus. An average of 
1/8th of the alleles should come from each founder at any given locus. Also, DO 
mice are a *population* of mice, not a single strain. While it is true that 
results in an individual DO mouse may not be reproducible, results at the 
population level should be reproducible. This is similar to the human population
in that results from one individual may not represent all humans, but results at
the population level should be reproducible.

The benzene inhalation study was conducted in two separate cohorts (termed 
*study* in the `pheno` object). Let's plot the proportion of micronucleated 
reticulocytes in bone marrow versus the benzene concentration for each study 
cohort.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Remember, you just need to show the basic plot. Just type out the ggplot,
geom, log scale, and facet wrap lines in class.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8,warning=FALSE}
pheno |>
  mutate(conc = factor(conc)) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(conc, prop.bm.mn.ret * 1000, color = conc)) +
    geom_violin(draw_quantiles = 0.5, linewidth = 1.25) +
    geom_beeswarm() +
    scale_y_log10() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Reds") +
    facet_wrap(~study, ncol = 2) +
    labs(title = "Bone Marrow MN-RET by Study Cohort") +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 20), 
          legend.position = "none")
```

As you can see, while individual mice have varying micronucleated 
reticulocytes, there is a dose-dependent increase in micronucleated reticulocytes
in both cohorts. This is an example of how results in the DO reproduce at the 
population level.

### Markers

The markers are the SNPs on the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array 
([MUGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4751547/)) 
that were used to reconstruct the haplotypes of the DO mice. This version of
the array had about 8,000 SNPs on it. The latest version contains over 
140,000 SNPs. We are using this smaller data set so that we can finish the
analysis in a timely manner during class.

The markers have been mapped to the latest mouse genome build (GRCm39) and
are provided by Karl Broman on Github at: 
<https://github.com/kbroman/MUGAarrays/tree/main/UWisc>. There are four
versions of the MUGA platforms. In this study, we used the MUGA and those
marker files are named as "muga_uwisc_vN.csv", where "N" is a version number.
We will use version 4, which you downloaded into your "data" directory 
during the Setup before the workshop.

Open the marker file now:

```{r}
markers = read.csv("./data/muga_uwisc_v4.csv")
```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 5: Which columns contain the marker positions?

Look at the structure of the genetic or physical map in the Environment tab and
see which columns contain marker positions in some coordinate system.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
str(markers)
```

The columns labelled "bp_mm10", "bp_grcm39", and "cM_cox" contain marker
positions.

::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 6: Which chromosomes are in the markers?

Use an R command to determine which chromosomes are in `markers`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
count(markers, chr)
```

There are 23 chromosomes, including some markers with "NA". These are markers
that could not be uniquely mapped to one chromosome.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 6: What do you think the difference is between teh "bp_mm10" and
"bp_grcm39" columns?

Turn to your neighbor and discuss what the differences between the two column
are. Then share your ideas with the class.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

There are different builds of the mouse genome. The Genome Resource Consortium 
(GRC) named mouse builds from build 1 to 39. The University of California at 
Santa Cruz developed their own naming system which conflicted with the GRC 
names. "GRCm38" was equivalent to "mm10". We are using the GRC naming 
conventions for genome builds.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

[qtl2](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl2) needs the markers to be in a specific 
format. `qtl2` requires that the markers be in a list. The 
[qtl2convert](https://github.com/kbroman/qtl2convert) package provides functions
to make this easier.

First, we will filter the markers to retain ones on the autosomes and Chr X. We
don't use the mitochondrial or Y chromosomes in mapping, but they may be 
important covariates. The MUGA did not contain enough markers on Chr M and Y
to identify the contributing founder strain, but later versions of the MUGA, 
such as the GigaMUGA, do contain enough markers to identify founder 
contributions.

```{r}
markers <- markers |>
             filter(chr %in% c(1:19, 'X'))
```

Next, we will create a column with GRCm39 Mb positions.

```{r}
markers <- markers |>
             mutate(pos = bp_grcm39 / 1e6)
```

Finally, we will use the [qtl2convert::map_df_to_list()]()
function to create the list of markers that `qtl2` requires. We will call this
object the marker "map" to distinguish it from the marker data.frame.

```{r}
map = qtl2convert::map_df_to_list(map = markers, pos_column = "pos")
```


### Founder Allele Probabilities (Genoprobs)

The `probs` object is a list with 20 elements. Each element of `probs` is a 
three-dimensional array containing the founder allele dosages for each sample at
each marker on one chromosome. These probabilities have been pre-calculated for 
you, so you can skip the step for calculating allele probabilities.

Let's look at the dimensions of `probs` for chromosome 1:

```{r}
dim(probs[[1]])
```

`probs[[1]]` is a three-dimensional array containing the proportion of each 
founder haplotype at each marker for each DO sample.  The `r nrow(probs[[1]])`
samples are in the first dimension, the 8 founders in the second and the 
`r dim(probs[[1]])[3]` markers along chromosome 1 are in the third dimension.

The figure below illustrates the structure of the `probs` object. `prob` is a
list with one element per chromosome. Each element is a three-dimensional array
which contains the founder allele probabilities for eahch sample at each marker.

![Genoprobs Object](fig/genoprobs_3D.png){alt='Three-dimensional figure of genoprobs list.',width='100%}

Let's return to the `probs` object. Look at the contents of one sample on 
chromosome 1.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

This code is intended to throw an error. It is used to illustrate the point
that you have to align the markers between `probs` and `map`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot_genoprob(probs, map, ind = 1, chr = 1)
```

Uh oh! We have an error which says "Different numbers of positions in probs and 
map". This means that the number of markers in the genoprobs and the marker
map is different. In fact, this is quite important. The markers in `probs` and
`map` must match **exactly** on every chromosome.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 7: Align the markers in `probs` and `map`. 

Work with the person next to you to write a short script that will get the
intersection of the marker names in the `probs` and `map` for each 
chromosome, subset the markers in each object to only contain the common
markers, and make sure that the markers in `probs` are in the same order as in
`map`.

**Hint**: The markers names for each chromosome in `probs` are in dimention 3. 
i.e. dimnames(probs[[1]])[[3]] contains the marker names for chromosome 1.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

We will write a loop that gets the common markers between probs and map for 
each chromosome and then subsets them.

```{r}
# Verify that probs and map are the same length.
stopifnot(length(probs) == length(map))

# Verify that probs and map have their chromsomes in the same order.
stopifnot(names(probs) == names(map))

# Loop through each chromosome...
for(i in seq_along(probs)) {
  
  # Get the intersection of the markers in probs and map.
  common_markers <- intersect(dimnames(probs[[i]])[[3]], names(map[[i]]))
  
  # Subset the map to contain the common markers.
  map[[i]] <- map[[i]][common_markers]
  
  # Subset the probs to contain the common markers.
  probs[[i]] <- probs[[i]][,,names(map[[i]])]
  
  # Verify that the markers are identical in probs and map.
  stopifnot(dimnames(probs[[i]])[[3]] == names(map[[i]]))
  
} # for(i)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have aligned the markers in `probs` and `map`, let's plot the 
allele probabilities for one sample on chromosome 1.

```{r fig.width=10,height=6}
plot_genoprob(probs, map, ind = 1, chr = 1, main = "Founder Allele Probabilities")
```

In the plot above, the founder contributions, which range between 0 and 1, are 
colored from white (= 0) to black (= 1.0). A value of ~0.5 is grey. The markers 
are on the X-axis and the eight founders (denoted by the letters A through H) on
the Y-axis. Starting at the left, we see that this sample has genotype BB 
because the row for B is black, indicating values of 1.0. Moving along the 
genome to the right, the genotype becomes CE where rows C and E are gray, 
followed by CD, FH, AG, GH, etc. The values at each marker sum to 1.0.  

The figure below shows genotype and allele probabilities for 3 samples. In the 
Diversity Outbred, there are 36 possible genotype states 
(AA, AB, AC, ..., BB, BC, BD, ..., CC, CD, CE, ..., DD, DE, DF, ..., EE,...) or 
8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1. The first SNP below has genotype BB. In the table 
describing alleles (8 state founder probabilities), the probability that this 
SNP has a B allele is 1. The 2nd SNP has genotype BH, so the allele table shows 
a probability of 0.5 for B and 0.5 for H. The third SNP is either BG or BH, and 
has a probability of 0.5 for each of these genotypes. The allele table shows a 
probability of 0.5 for allele B, and 0.25 for both G and H.

![Genotype and allele probabilities](fig/geno-to-allele-probs.png){alt='a table showing the probabilities for each of 36 genotypes in the Diversity Outbred followed by a second table showing probabilities for each of the 8 founder alleles'}

### Calculating A Kinship Matrix

Next, we need to create a matrix that accounts for the kinship relationships 
between the mice. We do this by looking at the correlation between the founder 
haplotypes for each sample at each SNP. For each chromosome, we create a kinship
matrix using all markers *except* the ones on the current chromosome using the 
"loco" (leave-one-chromosome-out) method. Simulations suggest that mapping using
this approach increases the power to detect QTL.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

The sample IDs must be in the rownames of `probs`. The sample IDs will be
copied to the row and column names in the kinship matrices.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
           
```{r kinship, message=FALSE}
K <- calc_kinship(probs = probs, type = "loco")
```

Kinship values between pairs of samples range between 0 (no relationship) and 
1.0 (completely identical). Let's look at the kinship matrix for the first
50 samples.

```{r kinship_probs, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
n_samples <- 50
heatmap(K[[1]][1:n_samples, 1:n_samples])
```

The figure above shows kinship between all pairs of samples. Light yellow 
indicates low kinship and dark red indicates higher kinship. Orange values 
indicate varying levels of kinship between 0 and 1. The dark red diagonal of the
matrix indicates that each sample is identical to itself. The orange blocks 
along the diagonal may indicate close relatives (i.e. siblings or cousins).

### Covariates    

Next, we need to create additive covariates that will be used in the mapping 
model. We will use study cohort as a covariate in the mapping model. This is the
same as outbreeding generation since each cohort was purchased from successive
generations. If we were mapping with *all* mice, we would also add benzene 
concentration to the model. This study contained only male mice, but in most 
cases, you would include sex as an additive covariate as well.

To recap, you would normally add sex and outbreeding generation to the model.
In this case, we have one sex and are using `study` instead of generation.

```{r covariates}
addcovar <- model.matrix(~study, data = pheno)[,-1, drop = FALSE]
```         

The code above copies the `rownames(pheno)` to `rownames(addcovar)` as a side-effect.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

The sample IDs **must** be in the rownames of `pheno`, `addcovar`, `genoprobs` 
and `K`. `qtl2` uses the sample IDs to align the samples between objects. For 
more information about data file format, see
[Karl Broman's vignette on input file format](https://kbroman.org/qtl2/assets/vignettes/input_files.html).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Performing a Genome Scan

Before we perform our first genome scan, let's look at the mapping model. At 
each marker on the genotyping array, we will fit a model that regresses the 
phenotype (micronucleated reticulocytes) on covariates and the founder allele 
proportions.  

$y_i = \beta_ss_i+\sum_{j=1}^8(\beta_jg_{ij}) + \lambda_i + \epsilon_i$

where:  
  
$y_i$ is the phenotype for mouse $i$,
$\beta_s$ is the effect of study cohort,
$s_i$ is the study cohort for mouse $i$,
$\beta_j$ is the effect of founder allele $j$,
$g_{ij}$ is the probability that mouse $i$ carries an allele from founder $j$,
$\lambda_;<sub>_i$ is an adjustment for kinship-induced correlated errors for mouse $i$,
$\epsilon_i$ is the residual error for mouse $i$.

Note that this model will give us an estimate of the effect of each of the 
eight founder alleles at each marker. This will be important when we estimate
the founder allele effects below.

There are almost 600 samples in this data set and it may take several minutes to
map one trait. In order to save some time, we will map using only the samples in
the 100 ppm concentration group. We will create a smaller phenotype data.frame.

```{r}
pheno_100 <- pheno[pheno$conc == 100,]
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 8: How many mice are we mapping with?

Get the number of rows in `pheno_100`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

You can do this by looking at the number of observations for `pheno_100` in the 
Environment tab or in the Console.

```{r}
nrow(pheno_100)
```

There are `r nrow(pheno_100)` mice in `pheno_100`.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In order to map the proportion of bone marrow reticulocytes that were 
micro-nucleated, you will use the 
[scan1](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/plot_scan1.R) function. To 
see the arguments for 
[scan1](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/plot_scan1.R), you can type 
`help(scan1)`. First, let's map the *untransformed* phenotype. 
(Recall that we log-transformed it above).

```{r QTL, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
index <- which(colnames(pheno_100) == "prop.bm.mn.ret")
lod   <- scan1(genoprobs = probs, 
               pheno     = pheno_100[,index, drop = FALSE], 
               kinship   = K, 
               addcovar  = addcovar)
```

Next, we plot the genome scan.

```{r qtl_plot, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, warning=FALSE}
plot_scan1(x    = lod, 
           map  = map, 
           main = "Proportion of Micro-nucleated Bone Marrow Reticulocytes")
```

It looks like we have a large peak on chromosome 10. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 9: How does a log-tranformation change the QTL plot?

1. Perform a genome scan on the column called `log_mnret`. (Hint: set `index` 
to the column index in `pheno`.)  
2. How does the LOD score for the peak on Chr 10 change?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
index <- which(colnames(pheno_100) == "log_mnret")
lod2  <- scan1(genoprobs = probs, 
               pheno     = pheno_100[,index, drop = FALSE], 
               kinship   = K, 
               addcovar  = addcovar)
plot_scan1(x    = lod2, 
           map  = map, 
           main = "(log(Proportion of Micro-nucleated Bone Marrow Reticulocytes)")
```

Using a log transformation increases the LOD increase from about 17 to over 25.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The challenge shows the importance of looking at your data and transforming it 
to meet the expectations of the mapping model. In this case, a log 
transformation improved the model fit and increased the LOD score. We will 
continue the rest of this lesson using the log-transformed data. Set your 
`index` variable equal to the column index of `log.MN.RET`. Redo the genome scan
with the log-transformed reticulocytes.

```{r set_pheno_index_to_log}
index <- which(colnames(pheno) == "log_mnret")
lod   <- scan1(genoprobs = probs, 
               pheno     = pheno_100[, index,  drop = FALSE], 
               kinship   = K, 
               addcovar  = addcovar)
```

## Assessing Significance of LOD Scores

There is clearly a large peak on Chr 10. But is it significant? In other words,
could we see a LOD score over 25 by chance? And if so, what is the probability 
of seeing a LOD of 25 or higher? 

These questions are most commonly answered via 
[permutation](https://www.genetics.org/content/178/1/609.long) of the sample
labels and recording the maximum LOD score in each permutation. This procedure 
breaks the connection between the phenotypes and the genotypes of the mice, so 
the results represent the expected LOD by chance.

Imagine that you shuffle the sample labels in the phenotype file and map the
resampled trait. Then you record the maximum LOD across the genome. You would
get a table that looks like this:

Permutation | Max LOD 
------------|--------
     1      |   1.7
     2      |   3.2
     3      |   2.2
     4      |   1.8
     5      |   2.3

Once you ran 1,000 permutations, you could plot a histogram of the maximum LOD
values. 

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
perms   <- readRDS('./data/sim_perm1000.rds')
max_lod <- apply(perms, 2, max)
hist(max_lod, breaks = 100, main = 'Histogram of Max. LOD')
q95     <- quantile(max_lod, probs = 0.95)
abline(v = q95, col = 'red', lwd = 2)
```

In this case, the maximum LOD score is around 9. Most of the values fall 
between 5 and 6. We have drawn a red line at the 95th percentile of the 
distribution. LOD values above this are likely to occur 5% of the time. That
means 1 in 20 times. We often use this 95th percentile as our significance
threshold for one trait.

We advise running at least 1,000 permutations to obtain significance thresholds.
In the interest of time, we perform 100 permutations here using the 
[scan1perm]() function.

```{r perms, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
perms <- scan1perm(genoprobs = probs, 
                   pheno     = pheno_100[,index, drop = FALSE], 
                   kinshp    = K,
                   addcovar  = addcovar, 
                   n_perm    = 100)
```

The `perms` object contains the maximum LOD score from each genome scan of 
permuted data.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 10: How does a log-tranformation change the QTL plot?

1. Create a histogram of the LOD scores `perms`. Hint: use the `hist()` function.  
2. Estimate the value of the LOD score at the 95th percentile.  
3. Then find the value of the LOD score at the 95th percentile using the 
`summary()` function.  

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
hist(x = perms, breaks = 15)
summary(perms)
```

Note that this summary function returns the 95th percentile value of the LOD
distribution.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can now add thresholds to the previous QTL plot. We use a significance 
threshold of p < 0.05. To do this, we select the 95th percentile of the 
permutation LOD distribution.
           
```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8,warning=FALSE}
plot_scan1(x    = lod, 
           map  = map,  
           main = "Proportion of Micro-nucleated Bone Marrow Reticulocytes")
thr <- summary(perms)
add_threshold(map = map, thresholdA = thr, col = 'red')
```

The peak on Chr 10 is well above the red significance line.

## Finding LOD Peaks

We can find all of the peaks above the significance threshold using the 
[find_peaks](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/find_peaks.R) function.

```{r find_peaks}
find_peaks(scan1_output = lod,
           map          = map, 
           threshold    = thr)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 11: How does a log-tranformation change the QTL plot?

Find all peaks for this scan whether or not they meet the 95% significance threshold.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
find_peaks(scan1_output = lod, 
           map          = map)
```

Notice that some peaks are missing because they don't meet the default threshold
value of 3. See `help(find_peaks)` for more information about this function.

::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The support interval is determined using the  
[Bayesian Credible Interval](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11560912) and 
represents the region most likely to contain the causative polymorphism(s). We 
can obtain this interval by adding a `prob` argument to 
[find_peaks](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/find_peaks.R). We pass 
in a value of `0.95` to request a support interval that contains the causal SNP 
95% of the time.

```{r interval}
find_peaks(scan1_output = lod, 
           map          = map, 
           threshold    = thr, 
           prob         = 0.95)
```

From the output above, you can see that the support interval is 2.3 Mb wide 
(31.7442 to 34.05311 Mb). The location of the maximum LOD score is at 33.52438 Mb.

## Estimated Founder Allele Effects

We will now zoom in on Chr 10 and look at the contribution of each of the eight
founder alleles to the proportion of bone marrow reticulocytes that were 
micro-nucleated. Remember, the mapping model above estimates the effect of each 
of the eight DO founders. We can plot these effects (also called 'coefficients')
across Chr 10 using [scan1coef](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/scan1coef.R).

```{r coef}
chr    <- 10
coef10 <- scan1blup(genoprobs = probs[,chr], 
                    pheno     = pheno_100[,index, drop = FALSE], 
                    kinship   = K[[chr]], 
                    addcovar  = addcovar)
```

This produces an object containing estimates of each of the eight DO founder 
allele effect. These are the <i>&beta;<sub>j</sub></i> values in the mapping 
equation above.

```{r fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
plot_coefCC(x    = coef10, 
            map  = map, 
            scan1_output = lod, 
            main = "Proportion of Micro-nucleated Bone Marrow Reticulocytes")
```

The top panel shows the eight founder allele effects (or model coefficients) 
along Chr 10. The founder allele effects are centered at zero and the units are 
the same as the phenotype. You can see that DO mice containing the CAST/EiJ 
allele near 34 Mb have lower levels of micro-nucleated reticulocytes. This means
that the CAST allele is associated with less DNA damage and has a protective 
effect. The bottom panel shows the LOD score, with the support interval for the 
peak shaded blue. 

## SNP Association Mapping

At this point, we have a 2.3 Mb wide support interval that contains 
polymorphism(s) that influence benzene-induced DNA damage. Next, we will impute 
the DO founder sequences onto the DO genomes. The 
[Mouse Genomes Project](https://www.mousegenomes.org/)
has sequenced the eight DO founders and provides SNP, insertion-deletion 
(indel), and structural variant files for the strains (see 
[Baud et.al., Nat. Gen., 2013](https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n7/full/ng.2644.html)). 
We can impute these SNPs onto the DO genomes and then perform association 
mapping. The process involves several steps and I have provided a function to 
encapsulate the steps. To access the Sanger SNPs, we use a SQLlite database 
provided by [Karl Broman](https://github.com/kbroman). You should have 
downloaded this during Setup. It is available from  
[figshare](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/40157572), but the file is 
10 GB, so it may take too long to download right now.

![SNP Imputation](fig/DO.impute.founders.sm.png){alt='Figure showing haplotypes being used to impute founder SNPs onto DO genomes',width='100%'}

Association mapping involves imputing the founder SNPs onto each DO genome and 
fitting the mapping model at each SNP. At each marker, we fit the following model:  

$y_{im} = \beta_ss_i+\beta_mg_{im} + \lambda_i + \epsilon_i$

where:

$y_i$ is the phenotype for mouse $i$,
$\beta_s$ is the effect of study cohort,
$s_i$ is the study cohort for mouse $i$,
$\beta_m$ is the effect of adding one allele at marker $m$,
$g_{im}$ is the allele call for mouse $i$ at marker $m$>,
$\lambda_i$ is an adjustment for kinship-induced correlated errors for mouse $i$,
$\epsilon_i$ is the residual error for mouse $i$.

We can call [scan1snps](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/scan1snps.R) 
to perform association mapping in the QTL interval on Chr 10. We first create 
variables for the chromosome and support interval where we are mapping. We then 
create a function to get the SNPs from the founder SNP database.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

It is important to use the `keep_all_snps = TRUE` in order to return all SNPs.

```


The `assoc` object is a list containing two objects: the LOD scores for each 
unique SNP and a `snpinfo` object that maps the LOD scores to each SNP. To plot 
the association mapping, we need to provide both objects to the [plot_snpasso](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/plot_snpasso.R) 
function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#png('./fig/bm_mnret_assoc_fig1.png', width = 2000, height = 2000, res = 256)
plot_snpasso(scan1output = assoc$lod, 
             snpinfo     = assoc$snpinfo, 
             main        = "Proportion of Micro-nucleated Bone Marrow Reticulocytes")
#dev.off()
```

![Bone Marrow MN-RET Association Mapping](fig/bm_mnret_assoc_fig1.png){alt='Plot showing LOD of each SNP in QTL interval',width='100%'}


This plot shows the LOD score for each SNP in the QTL interval. The SNPs occur 
in "shelves" because all of the SNPs in a haplotype block have the same founder 
strain pattern. The SNPs with the highest LOD scores are the ones for which 
CAST/EiJ contributes the alternate allele.

You might naturally ask what genes are under this QTL peak. We will query the 
SNP/gens database for the genes in the interval. As before, we will create a
function to query the genes in a specific interval of the genome.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create function to query gene database.
query_genes <- create_gene_query_func(dbfile      = "./data/fv.2021.snps.db3",

The `genes` object contains annotation information for each gene in the interval.

Next, we will create a plot with two panels: one containing the association 
mapping LOD scores and one containing the genes in the QTL interval. We do this 
by passing in the `genes` argument to 
[plot_snpasso](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2/blob/master/R/plot_snpasso.R). We 
can also adjust the proportion of the plot allocated for SNPs (on the top) and 
genes (on the bottom) using the 'top_panel_prop' argument.

Note that you have to add the "genes", "colors", and "top_panel_prop" arguments.

![Bone Marrow MN-RET Association Mapping](fig/bm_mnret_assoc_fig2.png){alt='Plot showing LOD of each SNP in QTL interval with genes below',width='100%'}

Now that we have the genes in this interval, we would like to know which 
founders have the minor allele for the SNPs with the highest LOD scores. To do
this, we will highlight SNPs that are withing a 1 LOD drop of the highest LOD
and we will add an argument to show which founder contributes the minor allele
at the highlighted SNPs.

### Searching for Candidate Genes

One strategy for finding genes related to a phenotype is to search for genes 
with expression QTL (eQTL) in the same location. Ideally, we would have liver 
and bone marrow gene expression data in the DO mice from this experiment. 
Unfortunately, we did not collect this data. However, we have liver gene 
expression for a separate set of untreated DO mice 
[Liver eQTL Viewer](https://churchilllab.jax.org/qtlviewer/svenson/DOHFD). We 
searched for genes in the QTL interval that had an eQTL in the same location. 
Then, we looked at the pattern of founder effects to see if CAST stood out. We 
found two genes that met these criteria.

![Sult3a1/Sult3a2 Liver eQTL](fig/French.et.al.Figure3.png){alt='Figure showing LOD plots of Sult3a1 & 2 and CAST-specific haplotype effects',width='75%'}

The plot above shows the genome scane for two genes: *Sult3a1* and 
*Gm4794*. *Gm4794* has been renamed to *Sult3a2*. As you can see, both *Sult3a1*
*Sult3a2* have eQTL in the same location at the MN-RET QTL on Chr 10. Mice 
carrying the CAST allele (in green) express these genes more highly. *Sult3a1* 
is a [sulfotransferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfotransferase) that 
may be involved in adding a sulfate group to phenol, one of the metabolites of 
benzene. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 12: Look for Sult3a1 & Sult3a2 QTL in DO bone expression

Go to the [DO Bone eQTL Viewer](https://churchilllab.jax.org/qtlviewer/DO/bone),
type in *Sult3a1* and click on the search button. Then search on *Sult3a2*.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 
 
Neither *Sult3a1* or *Sult3a2* has an eQTL in the DO bone marrow data set.

:::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Next, we will look at the relationship between *Sult3a1* and *Sult3a2*. Go to the 
Ensembl web page for 
[Sult3a2](https://useast.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSMUSG00000090298;r=10:33642420-33662700).
In the menu on the left, click on the "Gene Tree (image)" link.

![Ensembl gene tree of Sult3a1 & Sult3a2](fig/Ensembl_Mouse_Sult3a1_Sult3a2.png){alt='Figure showing that Sult3a1 & 2 are paralogs',width='100%'}

As you can see, *Sult3a2* is a paralog of *Sult3a1* and hence both 
genes are sulfotransferases. These genes encode enzymes that attach a sulfate 
group to other compounds.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 13: Look for structural variants near Sult3a1

Go to the [Ensembl website](https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html) and select
"Mouse" from the species dropdown. Then type "10:33300000-33800000" into the
search box and press "Go". Scroll down to the detailed view and look for 
structural variants in this region.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You should see a plot similar to the one below. 

![Ensembl Structural Variants](fig/Ensembl_SV_Chr10.png){alt='Ensembl viewer showing genes and structural variants under that chromosome 10 QTL peak',width='100%'}

:::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


![Ensembl Structural Variants](fig/Ensembl_SV_Chr10.png){alt='Ensembl viewer showing genes and structural variants under that chromosome 10 QTL peak',width='100%'}


In order to visualize the size of the copy number gain, we queried the 
Mouse Genomes Project [alignment files](https://www.mousegenomes.org/mouse-strains-sequenced/) 
for the eight founders. We piled up the reads at each base (which is beyond the 
scope of this tutorial) and made the figure below.

![DO Founder BAM file pileups](fig/French.et.al.Sup.Figure3.png){alt='Figure showing CAST with a duplication at the Sult3a1/2 locus.',width='100%'}

As you can see, there appears to be a duplicatation in the CAST founders that 
covers four genes: *Clvs2*, *Gm15939*, *Sult3a1* and *Sult3a2*. *Clvs2* is 
expressed in neurons and *Gm15939* is a predicted gene that may not produce a 
transcript.

Hence, we have three pieces of evidence that narrows our candidate gene list to 
*Sult3a1* and *Sult3a2*:

1. Both genes have a liver eQTL in the same location as the micronucleated 
reticulocytes QTL.
2. Among genes in the micronucleated reticulocytes QTL interval, only *Sult3a1*
and *Sult3a2* have differential expression of the CAST allele in the liver.
3. There is a copy number gain of these two genes in CAST.

Sulfation is a prominent detoxification mechanism for benzene as well. The 
diagram below shows the metabolism pathway for benzene 
[(Monks, T. J., et al. (2010). Chem Biol Interact 184(1-2): 201-206.)](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4414400) 
Hydroquinone, phenol and catechol are all sulfated and excreted from the body.

![Benezene metabolism pathways](fig/Monks_ChemBiolInter_2010_Fig1.jpg){alt='Figure showing benezene metabolism pathways',width='100%'}

This analysis has led us to the following hypothesis. Inhaled benzene is 
absorbed by the lungs into the bloodstream and transported to the liver. There,
it is metabolized, and some metabolites are transported to the bone marrow. One 
class of genes that is involved in toxicant metabolism are sulfotransferases. [<i>Sult3a1</i>](https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1931469) is a phase 
II enzyme that conjugates compounds (such as phenol, which is a metabolite of 
benzene) with a sulfate group before transport into the bile. It is possible 
that a high level of *Sult3a1* expression could remove benzene by-products
and be protective. Our hypothesis is that the copy number gain in the CAST 
allele increases liver gene expression of *Sult3a1* and *Sult3a2*. High liver 
expression of these genes allows mice containing the CAST allele to rapidly 
conjugate harmful benzene metabolites and excrete them from the body before 
they can reach the bone marrow and cause DNA damage. Further experimental 
validation is required, but this is a plausible hypothesis.

![Benzene metabolism hypothesis](fig/benzene_hypothesis.png){alt='Figure showing mice carrying the CAST allele being protected from benezene toxicity',width='100%'}

We hope that this tutorial has shown you how the DO can be used to map QTL and 
use the founder effects and bioinformatics resources to narrow down the 
candidate gene list. Here, we made used of external gene expression databases 
and the founder sequence data to build a case for a pair of genes.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 14: Map another trait.

1. Make a histogram of the column `pre.prop.mn.ret` in `pheno`. Does it look 
like it should be log transformed? If so, add a column to `pheno` that contains 
the log of `pre.prop.mn.ret`.  
2. Perform a genome scan *using all samples* on the column called 
`pre.prop.mn.ret`. Since you're using all samples, the scan will take longer.
You will also need to add the benezene concentration to the covariates.
(Hint: set `index` to the column index in `pheno`.)  
3. Which chromosome has the highest peak? Use `find_peaks` to get the location 
and support interval for the highest peak.  
4. Calculate and plot the BLUPs for the chromosome with the highest peak. (This 
may take a few minutes.) Which founder contributes an allele that makes MN-RET
values higher?
5. Perform association mapping in the support interval for the QTL peak, 
plot the results and plot the genes beneath the association mapping plot.

                 addcovar  = addcovar2)
plot_scan1(x    = lod_pre, 
           map  = map, 
           main = "Log-Transformed Pre-dose micronucleated reticulocytes")
```

3. Find peaks above a significance threshold.

```{r}
find_peaks(lod_pre, map, threshold = 8, prob = 0.95)
```

4. Calculate and plot BLUPs for the highest peak.

```{r}
chr   <- 4
coef4 <- scan1blup(genoprobs = probs[,chr], 
                   pheno     = pheno[,index, drop = FALSE], 
                   kinship   = K[[chr]], 
                   addcovar  = addcovar2)
plot_coefCC(x            = coef4, 
            map          = map, 
            scan1_output = lod_pre, 
            legend       = "topleft",
            main         = "Log-Transformed Pre-dose micronucleated reticulocytes")
```

5. Perform association mapping in the QTL interval for the highest peak.

```{r eval=FALSE}
start  <- 132.8
end    <- 134.3
assoc4 <- scan1snps(genoprobs  = probs[,chr], 
                    map        = map, 
                    pheno      = pheno[,index,drop = FALSE], 
                    kinship    = K, 
                    addcovar   = addcovar2, 
                    query_func = query_snps, 
                    chr        = chr,
                    start      = start, 
                    end        = end, 
                    keep_all_snps = TRUE)

genes <- query_genes(chr, start, end)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#png('./fig/pre_mnret_assoc.png', width = 2000, height = 2000, res = 256)
plot_snpasso(scan1output = assoc4$lod, 
             snpinfo     = assoc4$snpinfo, 
             main        = "Log-Transformed Pre-dose micronucleated reticulocytes", 
             genes       = genes,
             colors      = "black",
             panel_prop = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.5),
             drop_hilit  = 1.0,
             col_hilit   = 'red',
             sdp_panel   = TRUE)
#dev.off()
```

- There are generally five steps to QTL mapping in DO mice: 
    - map the trait,
    - perform permutations,
    - find significant peaks,
    - calculate founder allele effects at the QTL peak,
    - perform association mapping to narrow the gene candidates.
- You may need to bring in outside resources to help narrow your candidate
gene list.
- You will need the 10 GB SNP database to perform association mapping.
